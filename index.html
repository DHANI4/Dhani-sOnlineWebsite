        <h3>Introduction to Origami</h3>
       <img src="into.png"width="200" height="200">
    <p>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. 
    <br/> In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
    <br/> At its essence, origami is the traditional Japanese game of folding elaborately designed paper into a myriad of shapes, typically plants, animals, and other living things.
    <br/>Part of what makes origami unique is the fact that it simply requires a piece of paper and a creative imagination.
